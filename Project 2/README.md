One project down and I am feeling like a challenge. As I have mentioned in my previous post, most of my experience with microcontrollers comes with the Arduino Ecosystem. This was sufficient for fulfilling my individual curiosities, but I am hitting roadblocks in my current job when working with highly specific sensors that have high performance criteria. For this I need something more powerful. It is time to get my feet wet with the ESP32. My goal is to do the same thing I just did in the previous project. This time I will be using a temperature and humidity sensor, DFRobot's SHT31 and the Arduino Nano with an ESP32 onboard. But first, I want to better understand the differences in the hardware capabilities of the ESP32 and what I have worked with before.
