So time is not linear, and neither am I when it comes to projects. As I write this, I have not quite finished with project 2 yet. But sometimes it's okay to jump around. Sometimes you hit a dead end, or the current project doesn't pique your interest. It's okay to wander around, while still being able to keep sight.
